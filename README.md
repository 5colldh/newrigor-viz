# Visualizing The #NewRigor

This is a repo for data visualizations emerging from *The New Rigor*, an ongoing conversation at [Five College Digital Humanities](http://5colldh.org) about linking digital scholarship to useful structures of support and evaluation. We started this effort with a one-day mini conference in May 2015, and we're continuing work throughout the summer and into the fall. You can [learn more about *The New Rigor* here](http://thenewrigor.5colldh.org).

# So what is this all about?

During *The New Rigor*, we had lots of great conversation happening on Twitter. These visualizations are an attempt to look at that conversation in new ways, and share our work with a broader community.

# How are they made?

[D3, y'all](http://d3js.org), as well as some very useful and straightforward visualization templates from the [twarc](https://github/edsu/twarc) and [twarc-report](https://github.com/pbinkley/twarc-report) repos. I'm [Jeffrey Moro](http://jeffreymoro.com), a post-bac with 5CollDH and a novice to all things visualization, so follow along if you want to see me fumble around, or if you want to pitch in and fork this repo!

# Where can I see them in action? 

Go to [http://thenewrigor.5colldh.org/visualizations](http://thenewrigor.5colldh.org/viz) to check them out. So far, I've made a [timeline](http://thenewrigor.5colldh.org/viz/timeline) of all of the tweets sent out during the conference and a [force-directed layout](http://thenewrigor.5colldh.org/viz/force) that gives the tweets some sproingy action.
